Instructions to generate results presented in Figure 4 in

Bou Daher F, Chen Y, Bozorg B, Heywood Clough J, JÃ¶nsson H, Braybrook SA (2018)
Anisotropic growth is achieved through the additive mechanical effect of material 
anisotropy and elastic asymmetry

These instructions assume you have installed the Tissue software in file directory TISSUE.

'>' indicates that the command is to be executed in a terminal window (without the >), e.g.
> command

(A.i) To generate the middle panel with symmetric walls, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator symmetric.model 3Dhypocotyl.init nogrowth.rk

This will create a directory 'vtk' in which output files are generated.

These can be loaded into Paraview for visualisation ['File/Open' and select the file(s)
followed by pressing the 'apply' button]. To help visualising the right thing,
3Dhypocotyl.pvsm can be used to load visualisation settings and files used for the 
figure into Paraview ['File/Load State...', Select the 3Dhypocotyl.pvsm file, 
Choose 'Search files under specified directory' and select the vtk directory].
Note that the above mentioned Paraview state file is generated from Paraview 4.0.1.
Loading it in other versions may result in errors. 

Note, that new simulations will again save the results in the vtk directory, so if
you would like to save multiple output results, you need to either move the vtk
directory between simulations [e.g. >mv vtk symmetricOutput],
or run Tissue from different directories.

(A.ii) To generate the right panel with asymmetric (100x) walls, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator asymmetric.model 3Dhypocotyl.init nogrowth.rk

Paraview can be used to visualise the data generated in the 'vtk' directory as described above.

(B.i) To generate the left panel with symmetric anticlinal walls and anisotropic 
internal cell walls with only elastic deformation, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator -init_output symmetricAnisoW.init -init_output_format centerTriTissue symmetricAnisoW.model 3Dhypocotyl.init nogrowth.rk 

Paraview can be used to visualise the data generated in the 'vtk' directory as described above.
Note, the '-init_output_file' results in the final state being saved in the file symmetricAnisoW.init,
which will be used in step (B.iii) below.

(B.ii) To generate the sencond from left panel with asymmetric anticlinal walls and 
anisotropic internal cell walls with only elastic deformation, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator -init_output asymmetricAnisoW.init -init_output_format centerTriTissue asymmetricAnisoW.model 3Dhypocotyl.init nogrowth.rk 

Paraview can be used to visualise the data generated in the 'vtk' directory as described above. In addition,
the file asymmetricAnisoW.init to be used in step (B.iv) below is created.

(B.iii) To generate the second from right panel with symmetric anticlinal walls and anisotropic 
internal cell walls with growth, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator -centerTri_init symmetricAnisoWGrowth.model symmetricAnisoW.init growth.rk 1>symmetricAnisoW.data

Paraview can be used to visualise the data generated in the 'vtk' directory as described above. Note,
the symmetricAnisoW.init file is needed and is created in step (B.i) above.

(B.iv) To generate the right panel with asymmetric anticlinal walls and anisotropic internal cell walls with growth, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator -centerTri_init asymmetricAnisoWGrowth.model asymmetricAnisoW.init growth.rk 1>asymmetricAnisoW.data

Paraview can be used to visualise the data generated in the 'vtk' directory as described above. Note,
the asymmetricAnisoW.init file is needed and is created in step (B.ii) above.

Length and strain anisotropy information are generated in B.iii and B.iv from the simulations and stored 
in the files symmetricAnisoW.data and asymmetricAnisoW.data. First and second columns are the length and average 
strain anisotropy over the outer cell faces of epidermis. These can be used for plotting the graph in 4C. To do 
this using Gnuplot:

> gnuplot length.gnplt

which will generate a file length.eps (without some of the labels).
