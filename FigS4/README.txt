Instructions to generate results presented in Figure S4 in

Bou Daher F, Chen Y, Bozorg B, Heywood Clough J, Jönsson H, Braybrook SA (2018)
Anisotropic growth is achieved through the additive mechanical effect of material 
anisotropy and elastic asymmetry

These instructions assume you have installed the Tissue software in file directory TISSUE.

'>' indicates that the command is to be executed in a terminal window (without the >), e.g.
> command

Figure S4A:

(A.i) To generate the top left panel with symmetric walls and
anisotropic wall material on internal walls with only elastic
deformation, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator -init_output_file symmetricAnisoW.init symmetricAnisoW.model 3Dhypocotyl.init nogrowth.rk

Paraview can be used to visualise the data generated in the 'vtk'
directory as described for Fig 4. Note, the '-init_output_file'
results in the final state being saved in the file
symmetricAnisoW.init, which will be used in step (A.iii) below.

(A.ii) To generate the top right panel with asymmetric walls and
anisotropic wall material on internal walls with only elastic
deformation, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator -init_output_file asymmetricAnisoW.init asymmetricAnisoW.model 3Dhypocotyl.init nogrowth.rk

Paraview can be used to visualise the data generated in the 'vtk'
directory as described for Fig4. In addition, the file
asymmetricAnisoW.init to be used in step (A.iv) below is created.

(A.iii) To generate the middle left panel with symmetric walls and
anisotropic wall material on internal walls with growth, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator symmetricAnisoWGrowth.model symmetricAnisoW.init growth.rk

Paraview can be used to visualise the data generated in the 'vtk'
directory as described for Fig4. Note,
the symmetricAnisoW.init file is needed and is created in step (A.i) above.

(A.iv) To generate the middle right panel with asymmetric walls and
anisotropic wall material on internal walls with growth, run:

> TISSUE/bin/simulator asymmetricAnisoWGrowth.model asymmetricAnisoW.init growth.rk

Paraview can be used to visualise the data generated in the 'vtk'
directory as described for Fig 4. Note,
the asymmetricAnisoF.init file is needed and is created in step (A.ii) above.

(A.v) Bottom panel. Length information can be extracted from the
simulations above. For simplicity, we have saved the data in files
symmetricLength.data and asymmetricLength.data that can be used for
plotting the graph. To do this using Gnuplot:

> gnuplot length.gnplt

which will generate a file length.eps (without some of the labels).

Changes to the length when changing parameters can be extracted by
simulating the model/init files provided in the sensitivityF and
sensitivityW directories, respectively. For simplicity, we provide the
data in sensitivityF.data and sensitivityW.data for plotting. To plot
these data using Gnuplot:

> gnuplot sensitivity.gnplt

which will generate two files, sensitivityF.eps and sensitivityW.eps.

Figure S4C:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Length information can be extracted from simulations after changing
parameters. For simplicity, we have saved the data in the file
growth.data, which can be used for plotting the graph. To do this using Gnuplot:

> gnuplot growth.gnplt

which will generate a file growth.eps (without some of the labels).
